a tcp chat server written in NodeJS.  Just like 100 others

You can setup a temporary chat server by doing the following

1. go here: http://instantserver.io

2. get your free server for 35 minutes

3. ssh into it

4. curl https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2493493/serverSetup > serverSetup

5. chmod 777 serverSetup

6. ./serverSetup

7. Now that the server is up and running, you get your clients to connect to it at the ip address the server is running on at port 48.

Have fun.

*feel free to modify the chat.js file if youâ€™d like to customize it (or debug it for me?)
